// BusinessUnitFilter (the same control the Reports suite uses).
//
// Availability comes from useSelectableBusinessUnits, exactly as the control's own does, so the
// two can't disagree: the filter is offered whenever the login has more than one BU to choose
// between — the login's mapped BUs for a BU Admin/BU Head, the BU master for an Admin or Entity
// Admin (who have no mapping of their own and would otherwise get no filter at all). A login with
// a single BU gets none: the navbar already pins every screen to it, and 'all' resolves to that
// same BU anyway.
//
// Defaults to "All Business Units", same as Reports: a master opens showing every BU the login
// can reach, and narrowing to one is an explicit choice made here. That also means these screens
// no longer follow the navbar switcher — picking a BU here never changes the global selection or
// any other screen.
