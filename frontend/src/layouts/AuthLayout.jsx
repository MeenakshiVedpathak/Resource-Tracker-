      {/* Right panel — form. Desktop (`lg:`) resolves to exactly what it was before this mobile
          redesign: `flex flex-1 flex-col items-center justify-center bg-background px-6 py-12`,
          with a single plain `w-full max-w-sm` wrapper around the Outlet — every mobile-only
          piece below is either `lg:hidden` or has an `lg:` override that strips its mobile
          styling back to nothing, so desktop's rendered output doesn't change. Below `lg`, this
          is a full hero → floating card → footer stack (see the reference mock), not the old
          fade-then-form: the card's own rounded top corners now draw the boundary between the
          dark branding area and the light form area, so nothing here needs to fade to
          transparent by itself. No padding on this outer flex container on mobile — the hero,
          card, and footer each carry their own, so the hero/footer can run full-bleed
          edge-to-edge behind the card. */}
      <div className="relative flex flex-1 flex-col bg-background lg:items-center lg:justify-center lg:px-6 lg:py-12">
        {/* Mobile hero: dark navy (a subtle two-tone gradient for depth, not a fade-to-transparent
            — the card below draws the actual boundary), the existing logo asset (unmodified,
            static — no continuous pulse/glow loop, matching a clean non-flashy visual language),
            a short "Workforce Intelligence" label, and a one-line tagline.
            Padding here is deliberately tight (`pt-8 pb-8`, `mt-1.5`/`mt-2` between lines) — this
            whole hero → card → footer stack has to fit a real phone viewport height (minus
            browser chrome) without scrolling, not just look right in a tall screenshot, so every
            block in it is sized for that budget rather than for its own comfort in isolation.
            `pb-8` still gives the floating card's `-mt-8` (below) room to pull up without
            covering the tagline. `overflow-hidden` here is scoped to just this box (for the wave
            art), not the whole panel, so it can never clip the form beneath it on a short
            viewport. */}

            above via `-mt-3` so those corners visibly cut across the dark background — the
            "floating card" look — without covering the tagline text above (measured: at `-mt-8`
            the card's top edge landed 12px INTO the tagline, clipping it; `-mt-3` clears it with
            an ~8px margin instead). Padding trimmed to `pt-4 pb-3` for the same no-scroll budget
            as the hero above. `lg:` neutralizes all of that back to the original plain
            `w-full max-w-sm` wrapper with no margin/radius/shadow/padding/background of its own. */}

            least important content on the page, so it gets the least room.
            `mt-auto` pins it to the bottom of this flex column instead of sitting right under the
            card with dead white space below it — on any viewport taller than the hero+card
            content, this footer now absorbs that leftover space by sliding down to the actual
