// The shared Business Unit filter — one self-contained FilterPanel cell (label + select) so
// every report and master wires it in with a single line, and they all narrow by BU identically.
//
// Screens using this deliberately do NOT follow the navbar's globally-active BU. That switcher
// silently narrowed everything to one BU via the X-Company-Id header, which read as "no data"
// rather than "wrong BU" (a Client Service PO Hours Report showing nothing for a month that
// clearly had hours, because the hours belonged to a different BU). They start on ALL_BUS — the
// widest scope the login can actually be served — and the user narrows here instead. See
// services/apiClient's explicitBuScope, which turns the chosen value into the request's BU scope.
//
// Options and availability both come from hooks/useSelectableBusinessUnits: the BU master for a
// cross-BU login (Admin/Entity Admin/Platform Admin, who have no BU mapping of their own), the
// login's own mapped BUs otherwise. It renders nothing when there are fewer than two BUs to
// choose between — a login with one BU has nothing to narrow, and 'all' already resolves to that
// BU for them.
