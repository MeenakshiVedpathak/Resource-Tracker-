  // background refetch before Save was ever clicked.
  //
  // `buUnitsReady` guards a SECOND, subtler race the "fire once" fix above introduced: for a
  // company-less actor, `buUnits` is built from GET /companies (activeCompanies), a separate query
  // from GET /service-pos/:id (po) — if `po` happens to resolve first, this effect used to fire
  // with `buUnits` still `[]`, so `poCompanyUnit` was never found, `poIsSubBu` came out `false` no
  // matter what, and a PO whose BU actually WAS a Sub-BU got miscategorized as a root BU on that
  // one and only run — permanently for this mount, since the ref above stops it from ever
  // re-checking once activeCompanies finally loads. Confirmed live: editing a PO whose BU is a
  // Sub-BU intermittently reopened showing the OLD Sub-BU again after a successful save, because
  // the save itself round-tripped through this same misdetection. Waiting for the relevant
  // "still loading" flag (not just "the list is non-empty", which can't tell apart from "still
  // loading" from "genuinely empty tenant") before allowing the one-time reset to run and mark the
  // ref fixes it — `isLoadingCompanies` for a company-less actor (whose buUnits comes straight from
  // activeCompanies), `isLoadingMappedBus` for a BU-scoped one (whose buUnits/mappedBusinessUnits
  // comes from useSelectableBusinessUnits, which enriches the login's own BU mapping with
