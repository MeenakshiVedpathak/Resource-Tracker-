// ⚠️ GUESSED MAPPING — CONFIRM WITH BACKEND/ADMIN ⚠️
//
// The backend's Form Master only knows a form's `form_name` string (see POST /roles/forms
// response, e.g. { "Dashboard": [{ id, name: "Analytics Dashboard" }] }). It has no concept
// of a frontend route. Until the real Form Master rows exist, the `name` values below are
// GUESSES based on this app's current page titles/sidebar labels — they are almost certainly
// not identical to what a Management user will actually type into the new Form Master screen.
//
// The lookup below is case-insensitive/trimmed to reduce accidental breakage, but the key
// strings themselves still need to match whatever `form_name` values get seeded/entered.
// Any accessible-forms entry with no match here is dropped from the sidebar (see Sidebar.jsx)
// and logged via console.warn so mismatches are visible during rollout instead of silently
// wrong.
